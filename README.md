# ENS name crowdsourcing

My plan is to create a smart contract based solution to aid crowdsourcing of ens names for nonprofit projects.
The basic idea is to have a webpage, where you can deploy a crowdsourcing contract for each name auction.
At contract deployment it will be possible to specify the ens name, and the address of the beneficiary of the crowdsourcing.
The acquired name will belong to the smart contract, but the beneficiary will be able to control it just like normal except for reselling it.

The development is at a very early stage, I will update it soon, check back later.
